# 64a

6-4.    Modify the movie list so it is now a set of movies.  After the sentinel loop to fill up the set, let the user insert or delete by movie name (but do a check to see if it is already in the set - the elements must be unique for the insert).  Print values using the pointer or iterator.  The set will already be sorted, but then use the copy & iterator to print on the screen.

The following is ex6-4a.cpp with comments showing the missing lines of code.  Fill in the missing lines of code for part b - ex6-4b.cpp.  Attach your .cpp file and an output .txt file and submit.
